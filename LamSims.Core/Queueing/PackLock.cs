/// <summary>
/// An advisory lock over one pack code, held for that pack's whole run: verify, download and
/// install. A sequential queue orders one process against itself; this orders it against a
/// second instance, which would otherwise overwrite the same chunk sidecar, delete an archive
/// the other is still extracting, and share one connection budget between two transfers.
///
/// Nothing reaps a stale lock: the operating system closes the handle when a process dies,
/// however it died.
///
/// The lock file is deliberately left on disk when the lock is released, so its existence says
/// nothing about whether the lock is held; exclusion comes from the held handle alone. Deleting
/// it on release would let an acquirer that opened the path just before a release hold a lock on
/// an inode that no longer has a name, while the next acquirer creates a fresh inode at the same
/// path and holds it too. A stable path-to-inode mapping is what makes a second holder
/// impossible, for as long as nothing outside the application unlinks the file. A user or a
/// cleanup script that deletes a lock file mid-run reopens exactly that hole, since the holder
/// keeps its descriptor on the now-nameless inode while the next acquirer creates a fresh one.
/// That residue is inherent to POSIX advisory locking and is not fixable here.
