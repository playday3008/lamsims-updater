/// Writes text to a file so a crash mid-write cannot leave a torn or truncated file where a
/// good one belonged. The write lands beside the destination first and is flushed to disk
/// before the rename. Without that flush the temp file's bytes can still be sitting in the
/// page cache when the rename completes, and a power loss between the two leaves a
/// zero-length file at <paramref name="path"/>.
///
/// Each call writes through a temp name of its own, so two writers racing the same
/// destination degrade to last-one-wins. If they shared a name, the loser's cleanup would
/// unlink the winner's open temp file and neither write would land.
